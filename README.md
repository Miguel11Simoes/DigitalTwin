# DigitalTwin — Predictive Maintenance Platform

This repository contains a digital twin and AI pipeline for predictive maintenance.

## Structure

- `backend/` — Python APIs, database and machine learning models for industrial pump monitoring.
- `frontend/` — React-based web interface with 3D digital twin visualization.

## Current Scope

- Focus: industrial pumps predictive maintenance (vibration + process data)
- Models: CNN / neural networks trained for pump operating modes and anomaly detection

## Next Steps

- Generalize platform to multiple sectors (motors, HVAC, conveyors, etc.)
- Export downloadable AI models for deployment on a custom SoC with an AI accelerator.
